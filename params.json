{"name":"CrowdFlower client","body":"### Crowdsourcing services\r\nAccording to Wikipedia crowdsourcing is outsourcing some tasks to the crowds - a bunch of people living and working in different parts of the world. There are currently two major players in the field of crowdsourcing services: one is [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome) and the other one is [CrowdFlower](https://crowdflower.com/).\r\n\r\nCrowdFlowerClient is a simple client in Java using CrowdFlower RESTful web service API. With it you can:\r\n* create new job without data\r\n* create new job by uploading data in JSON or CSV\r\n* upload data to existing job\r\n\r\nIt is used in one of my other projects -- an extension for OpenRefine (@OpenRefine) (previously known as Google Refine).
